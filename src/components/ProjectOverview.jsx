A hit from an asteroid causes the player’s health to decrease. While smaller asteroids deal lesser damage, larger asteroids will deal a heavier blow to your health bar. Once the player’s health bar runs out, they lose a life.",

Despite, its numerous benefits, finding people to carpool with often proves to be quite a tedious affair. Due to this, effective execution of carpool proves to be a challenge. This Android carpooling system has been developed to help encourage carpooling by helping users “offer a ride” in their vehicle or “find a ride” with other users.",
